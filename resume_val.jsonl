Let's say over Flask" }, { "role": "user", "content": "Absolutely, Flask is a fantastic framework known for its simplicity, but for this project, Django's built-in features were pivotal. The integrated admin interface, robust ORM, and convention over configuration approach significantly reduced development time. Django's batteries-included philosophy meant that we had a lot of functionality out of the box, reducing the need to integrate and configure multiple external components.
