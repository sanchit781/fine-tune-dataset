Conversely, the Pub-Sub (Publish-Subscribe) pattern fosters a decoupled, flexible relationship. Publishers send messages to a message broker or channel, and subscribers receive relevant messages without knowledge of each other. This loose coupling enables communication through a central hub, allowing subscribers to control which messages they receive.

Rather than loading all resources or components when the application starts, lazy loading delays their initialization until they're required for execution. This optimizes performance and resource utilization by reducing the initial load time and conserving memory. For instance, in web development, images or sections of a webpage may be lazily loaded as the user scrolls, reducing the initial page load time.
